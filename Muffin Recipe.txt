Category:

Description:
Muffins are small, baked goods that are typically sweet and moist, but denser than cupcakes or cakes.

Key ingredients:
Sugar eggs flour butter

Ingredients:
1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour
•½ cup (50g) unsweetened cocoa powder
•1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
•2 tsp baking powder
•½ tsp baking soda
•¼ tsp salt
•¾ cup (180ml) milk (or buttermilk for extra moistness)
•½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil or melted butter
•2 large eggs
•1 tsp vanilla extract
•¾ cup (130g) chocolate chips (optional, for extra chocolatey muffins)

Instructions:
Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease it.
Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Combine Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth.
Mix the Batter: Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy. Fold in the chocolate chips, if using.
Fill Muffin Tin: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about ⅔ full.
Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 18–20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
Cool: Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
